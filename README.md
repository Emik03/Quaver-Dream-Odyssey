\>\>\> **Dream Odyssey (45/60) + [emme (60/60)](https://github.com/Emik03/Quaver-emme)**

Tiebreaker speedrun completed in 23:55:19, featuring an 11 hour discord call where we charted the song while hashing out the details. This is a collab with [asterSSH](https://quavergame.com/mapset/map/156687), a special thanks to them for their incredible SV contributions to this chart, for being amazingly cooperative, and simply being a good sport while we endured the consequences of sleep debt. All layering and most patterning done by myself, check bookmarks for SV author credits.
